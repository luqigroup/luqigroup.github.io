To this end, the LUQI group integrates generative modeling with scientific computing to develop scalable sampling techniques for high-dimensional distributions. This work enables Bayesian inference in large-scale PDE-based inverse problems (e.g., seismic and medical imaging) and provides a principled framework for building reliable, uncertainty-aware AI models for real-world applications."
