Our approach involves integrating generative modeling and scientific computing to develop scalable sampling techniques for high-dimensional distributions. This work enables Bayesian inference in large-scale PDE-based inverse problems (e.g., seismic and medical imaging) and provides a principled approach to designing reliable, uncertainty-aware AI models for real-world applications."
